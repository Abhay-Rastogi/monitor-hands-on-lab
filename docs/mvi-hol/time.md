1. Go back to the `Projects` tab and see how your new data set, `Inspection Results`, that you created in the app, is now a a part of your project.

2. Go to the `Data Sets` tab and select your new data set, `Inspection Results-YourInitials`, and take a look at the new images you took. 

3. Your model might be finished training, use a photo of a can to test your new model. <b>*Remember, it will not be as accurate because we did not train the model with a lot of images.*</b>
