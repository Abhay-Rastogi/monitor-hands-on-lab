# Monitor Asset Devices

## Create a Monitor Dashboard

Inside of your Entity Type homepage, right when you log in for the first time you will see a Dashboard card called “Hourly.” Upon clicking on the card, you will most likely see a dashboard that looks like this:

If you complete the full length Hands on Lab, your dashboard will look something like this. Today, we’ll get you on the right track:


### Add Line Graph Cards
Time series data is represented well as line graphs. Let's display the the critical performance metrics the Thingy is providing so that we can see historical trends and in later modules apply ai models to detect anomalies.

1.  Navigate back to the landing page for your entity type. You will see under “Summary Dashboards” an option to create a new dashboard. Click “+New Summary.”

2.  Next to “Definition,” click on “Contents.” Select which data you would like to graphed on your dashboard.  

3.  Select which aggregation methods  you would like to see on your line graphs for each of your data types (You created these in the Analytics Service chapters).

4.  Now, click on “Dashboard” next to contents. You can drag and drop the line graph cards that you just made in whichever orientation you see fit.

5.  Once you are content with your dashboard layout, click “Create Summary.” After a few minutes, you will end up with the beginnings of a sophisticated and value driven dashboard.

6.  Copy and paste the JSON lines 3 to 158 from “Monitor Final JSON without Image.json” into the top of the card array of your exported JSON. Copy and paste the JSON from my file beginning at the curly brace on line 3.

You are adding a few value cards to your dashboard. Please refer to the Full Hands on Lab in the Box folder if you would like to go through the whole lab.

Be careful of your commas, curly braces, and brackets or your JSON will get angry. In Atom, you can click on the curly brace at the top of your value card and it will underline that brace blue along with the last curly brace of the card. Make sure to put a comma after the last curly brace before the beginning of the next card.

You have finished the "Operational Monitoring of Assets" lab.
