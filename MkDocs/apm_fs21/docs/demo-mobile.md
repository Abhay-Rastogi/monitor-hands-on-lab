## Service Request to Work Order

Within Manage EAM, the newly created Service Request can be automated into a WO, where a manual review by a supervisor could occur where they can drill into related history records against the PUMP, they can also link directly to the monitor dashboard to review the details of the anomaly/alert.  Part of the evaluation may or may not give enough information to take immediate action, in which case they would apply an inspection template to the record, approve the work order and assign an appropriate resource.

## Execute Work Order
As a technician, I can login to Maximo Mobile and from the navigation page, click my Schedule to see work that has been assigned to me whether I’m in the break room, on the other side of the plant, or offline.<br>
`Action:` Go into Maximo Mobile, click Schedule, then Assigned work tabs. 

I see a work order was created based on alert, so I’m going to review the details of that work order. This automation of a work order saves the technician time from reviewing the service request.<br>
`Action:` Click on alert-based work order, Show the details of the work order.

I see in the long description a link that will take me to Monitor if I want to see more details about the anomaly. These failure codes for excessive vibration will now be used to update health and failure prediction dates later by Reliability Engineer. There is location information that will help direct me to the proper asset within the plant to perform the work order tasks.  

After I start my work order, the clock to records the time I spend on it.<br>`Action:` Click Start now in the work order that was created in Monitor.

By clicking on the TASK icon I can see the individual steps needed to complete the inspection.<br>
`Action:` Review the tasks assigned. 

The technician checks off the tasks as they are being performed. 

The technician has determined that the vibration is being caused by the pump skid being loose. 
`Action:` Check off tasks. Click done when complete.

## Close Work Order
He adds this to the comments in the work order work log that "it was a simple fix of tightening a loose bolt on the skid" and records his time and the failure.<br>
`Action:` Add comments and record time and failure. Select Failure Class, Problem, and Cause. Close out work order.

I will now hand it over to the reliability engineer to do some further analysis since the technician is only concerned about the assets in their care whereas the reliability engineer is looking across all sites/pumps.
